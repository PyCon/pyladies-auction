Doug's Rules for Running an Auction
--

*Increase the fun, prevent the feelbad's where possible.*

* Never bid on any items yourself.
* Never bid by proxy on any items.
* Never purchase items from a donor until 2 years after they have not donated.
* Be upfront and honest with those donating. Planned theatrics and surprises should not be so to them. Include them.
* All interactions must be on the pycon-auction mailing list.

As the person managing the auction, you don't get to take part. This extends to
being a patron of those who donate. If there is an artist's work they have donated
in the auction, you can not purchase from the donor for 2 years for example.
Volunteers do not have this restriction, but as the person working with donors,
this is not something you do.

Some items are hard to auction. Classes, services, and conference passes are very
valuable, but are not a good fit for the auction. Only those already planning on
using the service, taking the class or attending the conference will be interested.
Even if interested the timing is poor. As a result there are few bids and they are low.
This feels bad for those bidding, the donor, and the audience.
Be upfront and explain this and find a way to make it work. These work best as things 
to be granted to PyLadies who want them, and would not otherwise have access. 
Conference passes can be given out as a grant with expenses paid by the PSF for 
instance. These can be announced at the auction or commented that they were donated
and will be granted. Work with the donors to find the best fit. 

Some items work best if grouped together, or a group of items split apart. 
Some items can be fun if presented as a surprise, or parts of a set of items 'added' to the item being auctioned. 
The donor needs to know beforehand. They need to approve of it. Work together.

Volunteer runners/auctioneers rules
--

* May not bid on items.
* May have proxy bidders.
* There are special rules for proxy bidding.

**Blind Proxy Bidding**

* Auctioneer/runner/volunteer can not have any part in the auctioning of the item.
* No communication between the volunteer and the proxy bidder.

We can't prevent this type of proxy bidding, so making it official with clear guidelines is best.

**Public Proxy Bidding**

Having those running the auction take part in it feels bad for the attendees.
They feel bad bidding against those running the auction, and it feels unfair.
This results in it being unfair.

That is unless, you can make a fun game of it. This is a delicate balance and everyone 
needs to be on the same page. The proxy bidder should be far away from the front/stage.
The volunteer should be up front and visible, but not taking part in the auction at
this point. Charade rules apply. The volunteer can not verbally communicate w/ words
to the proxy. It should be clear and announced what is going on.

The visual interaction becomes part of the theater, and other bidders get extra information.
This feels more fun, and appears stressful for the volunteer, alleviating the stress on the
other bidders.

Only one of these is preferred and no more than two. More than that and if feels unfair.


The Jester
--

There are many terms for this special volunteer role. This is not needed for the auction, and can backfire badly. Only do this if you have the proper person for the role, and they are comfortable with it. This is best done by someone performing a photographer role, or as a runner. This is a person moving around the audience. 

The job of the jester is to taunt those bidding and make jokes. Not in a mean way. NEVER in a mean or derogatory way. Even self deprecating humor should be used sparingly by the Jester. They inject enthusiasm when energy is low, and can reinvigorate the room.

The auctioneers can also take part in this, but it is not the same as a person who is bouncing around the room between people. 

There can only be one Jester. It does not work when there is more than one. 

When there is a bidding war between two people, they could go to a third person who looks interested and ask for the runner to show the item to them for instance. Or say "Are you going to take that?" to the person whom was just out bid. Unlike other roles, this is not an 'announced' role, like the runners or auctioneers. 

The jester can also help with keeping track of the winning bid, and which attendees the auctioneer should focus on, and which ones are REALLY out, and not to bother. They are an extra set of eyes and ears out in the audience which can be very helpful.

This is hands down the most difficult role. It is exhausting. It also has the potential to go very wrong. If you choose to do this, do so carefully and have hand signals for communicating with the jester.
