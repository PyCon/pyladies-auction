Doug's Rules for Running an Auction
--

*Increase the fun, prevent the feelbad's where possible.*

* Never bid on any items yourself.
* Never bid by proxy on any items.
* Never purchase items from a donor until 2 years after they have not donated.
* Be upfront and honest with those donating. Planned theatrics and surprizes should not be so to them. Include them.
* All interactions must be on the pycon-auction mailing list.

As the person managing the auction, you don't get to take part. This extends to
being a patron of those who donate. If there is an artist's work they have donated
in the aution, you can not purchase from the donor for 2 years for example.
Volunteers do not have this restriction, but as the person working with donors,
this is not something you do.

Some items are hard to auction. Classes, services, and conference passes are very
valuable, but are not a good fit for the auction. Only those already planning on
using the service, taking the class or attending the conference will be interested.
Even if interested the timing is poor. As a result there are few bids and they are low.
This feels bad for those bidding, the donor, and the audiance.
Be upfront and explain this and find a way to make it work. These work best as things 
to be granted to PyLadies who want them, and would not otherwise have access. 
Conference passes can be given out as a grant with expenses paid by the PSF for 
instance. These can be announced at the auction or commented that they were donated
and will be granted. Work with the donors to find the best fit. 

Some items work best if grouped together, or a group of items split apart. 
Some items can be fun if presented as a surprise, or parts of a set of items 'added' to the item being auctioned. 
The donor needs to know beforehand. They need to approve of it. Work together.

Volunteer runners/auctioneers rules
--

* May not bid on items.
* May have proxy bidders.
* There are special rules for proxy bidding.

**Blind Proxy Bidding**

* Auctioneer/runner/volunteer can not have any part in the auctioning of the item.
* No communication between the volunteer and the proxy bidder.

We can't prevent this type of proxy bidding, so making it official with clear guidelines is best.

**Public Proxy Bidding**

Having those running the auciton take part in it feels bad for the attendees.
They feel bad bidding against those running the auciton, and it feels unfair.
This results in it being unfair.

That is unless, you can make a fun game of it. This is a delecate balance and everyone 
needs to be on the same page. The proxy bidder should be far away from the front/stage.
The volunteer should be up front and vissible, but not taking part in the auction at
this point. Charade rules apply. The volunteer can not verbally communicate w/ words
to the proxy. It should be clear and announced what is going on.

The visual interaction becomes part of the theater, and other bidders get extra information.
This feels more fun, and appears stressful for the volunteer, aleviating the stress on the
other bidders.

Only one of these is prefered and more than two. More than that and if feels unfair.
