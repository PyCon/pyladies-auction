# PyCon PyLadies Auction

Information on how the Auction is run, and the minimal code associated with it.


There is only one hard set rule:
    
    Increase the fun, while preventing the feelbad's, where possible.

The auction is broken into two parts:

* Voice Auction
* Raffle

TBD

* [TLDR](tldr.md) - quick overview of everything.
* [Item Donation Management](item-management.md) - Book keeping!
* [Auction Introduction](introduction.md) - How to run the live auction.
* [Doug's Rules](dougs-rules.md) - Ethics.

NOTE: We have considered having a silent auction, and other enhancements, but these are limited due to how we currently manage the item donation. We accept items for the auction up until the day of the auction. The expo hall is broken down Saturday afternoon just before the Auction, and we often get key items which are on display in the auction hall at this time. This can include Bikes, books, and other things which are prohibitive to be shipped. Due to this, it is hard to have a silent auction or an auction booklet printed up for the event.
